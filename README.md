# COVID-19-Spatial-Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation
Description - This Python Program is to show geo-spatial visual representations of multiple analysis, based on questionnaires from COVID-19 dataset (www.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv).
<br/>

Prerequisite tools as follow:
1) Jupyter Notebook (IDE) - To perform the computations for data analysis in python language that include import of libraries & datasets, analysis, create multiple Statistical Visualisations and save the Python File (.ipynb).            
2) Microsoft Excel - To open and/or read the structured or semistructed data. 
<br/>

Steps to use the prerequisite tools:
1) Download the latest Anaconda distribution from "www.anaconda.com" and select Jupyter Notebook as IDE for computions. Save to your local system.
2) Download the multiple datasets from "www.kaggle.com" in .csv format and save them in a folder on your local system.
